/**
 * Does the frame still fit, at every size it might be driven at?
 *
 *   node scripts/measure-fit.mjs [url]
 *
 * Reach for this after changing **any** height, gap or type size. It is the
 * script that catches the failure a single 1920x1080 check cannot.
 *
 * ── The trap it exists for ──
 *
 * The type and dimension tokens are `vw`, so they shrink with the frame. **The
 * `--s-*` spacing scale is fixed px and does not.** Every gap, padding and
 * margin therefore holds its size while everything around it contracts, which
 * means a band that merely *fits* at 1920 can overlap the header at 1600.
 * Measured, before this was budgeted properly: -15.8px of clearance at
 * 1600x900, on a layout that looked perfect at 1920.
 *
 * `clearance` is the gap between the bottom of the header and the top of the
 * highest thing in the board. **It must be positive at every size.** Aim for
 * 10px or more at the smallest size you care about; anything under ~5px is a
 * heading waiting to be overlapped by a font that loads a step heavier.

    // is not optional here** — without it this returned `null` on /weekly, and a
    // null clearance prints as "no number" rather than as a failure, which is
    // the quietest possible way for the one measurement this script exists for
    // to stop being taken. Measured while it was missing: -9.6px at 1600x900,
    // reported as `null`.
    //
    // It is `.tv-card-cell`, the whole grid cell, and **not `.tv-card`**, which
    // is now only the detail base sitting at the cell's *bottom*. Measuring that
    // reported 207.5px of clearance on a grid whose real top was 24px under the
    // header — a comfortable number that described the wrong edge.
    //
    // **`.tv-pod-numeral` first, because it is genuinely the topmost thing.**
    // Each rank numeral breaks above its card's edge, so the plinth's own top is
    // no longer the top of the slide — measured, a board reporting 86.4px of
    // clearance had its first-place numeral 42.8px from the frame edge. This is
    // the third time this script has described the wrong edge: `.tv-card` on
    // /weekly reported 207.5px on a grid whose real top was 24px, and the medal
    // that preceded these numerals reported 26.1px on a board whose real top was
    // 3.9px. The rule that keeps falling over is that the outermost *ink* is not
    // always the outermost *box*.
    //
    // **`.tv-pod-mover` is in the list too, and that is the fourth correction to
    // it.** The podium is bottom-anchored now, so its own top is hundreds of
    // pixels down and reporting that as "clearance" would describe a board with
    // acres of room while the mover panel sat at the real top edge. The number
    // has to mean the same thing on both slides: air above the topmost thing.
    //
    // **`.tv-card-numeral` is the fifth correction, and it is the same mistake
    // a fifth time.** /weekly's ranks 1-3 now carry the podium's metal numeral,
    // breaking above their cards exactly as the podium's break above their
    // pillars — so `.tv-card-cell` stopped being the top of that slide the
    // moment they landed. Measured with it missing: 63.5px of clearance
    // reported on a board whose real topmost ink was 12px under the header.
    //
    // The rule that keeps falling over is one line long: **the outermost ink is
    // not always the outermost box.** Anything that overflows its own container
    // upward belongs in this list, and nothing else does.
