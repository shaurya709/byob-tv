/**
 * One team's card: a solid Deep Forest object carrying rank, mark, venture name
 * and figure — the same anatomy a podium pillar has, at grid scale.
 *
 * ── What this replaced, and why ──
 *
 * The board used to be forty marks floating over forty near-invisible bases, and
 * it read as a sticker sheet. Four things caused that and all four are fixed
 * here rather than softened:
 *
 * - **The rank was painted on the artwork.** It needed a triple white
 *   drop-shadow to survive forty unknown logos and still lost — ranks 12 and 13
 *   were half-swallowed by SORTD and Blunnt. The badge is on the card's own
 *   surface now, where nothing of the venture's can cover it.
 * - **Nothing bound a mark to its figure.** The card does.
 * - **Every card was as loud as every other.** The bottom half of the board is
 *   the pale outlined kind now — see `quiet` below. The rule was revenue and is
 *   rank; the figure is what still follows revenue.
 *
 * ── One treatment per card, never both ──
 *
 * Ranks 4–40 get the badge. Ranks 1–3 get `/podium`'s metal numeral instead,
 * breaking above the card's top edge, in the podium's own class so the two
 * boards say gold with one implementation rather than two that drift.
 *
 * ── Rank sits on the cell, not on the card ──
 *
 * Both treatments are outside the travelling element, deliberately. Rank is a
 * fact about the *board*: a number that flew across the frame with a card would
 * be claiming to belong to the venture rather than to the position.
 */

/**
 * ── THE NAME WENT AND TODAY CAME BACK, ONTO THE SAME LINE ──
 *
 * The anatomy is rank, mark, week, today. It was rank, mark, name, week for one
 * revision, and the swap is deliberate rather than a reversal that lost track of
 * itself:
 *
 * - **The mark already identifies the venture at this size.** A 116px disc of a
 *   team's own artwork and its name underneath are the same fact printed twice,
 *   and the second printing cost the only line the card had spare.
 * - **Today was the only thing on the board that said who is moving *now*.**
 *   Without it the wall is a weekly summary on a screen; a passer-by at 4pm on a
 *   busy Friday has no way to see the afternoon in it.
 *
 * It also settles the overflow question the name never answered: five of forty
 * names did not fit on one line at 156px, and no truncation, marquee or short
 * display-name column is needed for a line that is no longer there.
 *
 * **The cost, stated rather than buried:** a team with no artwork is now a
 * coloured initial with no name anywhere on the card. Two teams are in that
 * state today. The disc's `alt` still carries the venture name, so the board is
 * not lying to anything that reads it — but at six metres those two cards say
 * only a letter, and that is the price of the line.
 */

/**
 * The three metals, by rank. **The podium's tokens, not copies of them** — the
 * two boards are in one rotation and a wall that says gold two ways is a wall
 * with a bug in it. Bronze is the settled `--metal-bronze`; the redder value it
 * replaced read as orange against `--tangerine-600`.

/**
 * **The mark crosses to the other slot. The card does not move at all.**
 *
 * The whole card used to travel, and an overtake across rank 20 therefore had
 * to change a card's fill in mid-flight — a box that changes colour while it
 * slides reads as a rendering fault rather than as an overtake. Slots hold
 * still and keep their colour; what moves between them is the mark, and what
 * changes is whose details are printed under it.
 *
 * The resize rides the travel because the rows descend: a mark crossing a row
 * boundary is 107px at one end and 88px at the other, and a snap at either end
 * would read as the mark arriving twice.
 *
 * `x`/`y`/`scale` hold at their start until the travel opens, so the turn
 * happens in place, and hold at the destination afterwards so the unturn
 * happens there. All three end exactly on the seat the re-sorted board is about
 * to give this mark, which is what makes the settle invisible.
