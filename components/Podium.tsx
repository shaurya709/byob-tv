/**
 * Slide 1 — the absolute leaderboard: three cards on metal plinths, and ranks
 * 4–10 as pill bars.
 *
 * ── The composition ──
 *
 * One tall card at the left, two short ones beside it, and the list filling the
 * well beneath the short pair. **The asymmetry is the ranking**: first place is
 * the only venture given a column to itself, and it does not have to be labelled
 * as first for that to read. Second and third are identical twins, as they are
 * on a real podium.
 *
 * The masthead spine that anchors all of this lives in `PodiumMasthead`.
 *
 * ── Rank is said three times ──
 *
 * Card size, the metal, and the numeral. Deliberately redundant: a greyscale
 * reproduction loses the metals, a photograph cropped to the cards loses the
 * numerals' overhang, and either one still ranks. This argument has survived
 * three redesigns of this slide and it is why none of the three carries rank
 * alone.
 *
 * ── What this deliberately spends ──
 *
 * This wall's rule is that movement means something happened. A permanently
 * idling mark spends that rule, and it was chosen knowingly: the idle is slow
 * and small where an overtake is fast, large and directional, so the two stay
 * distinguishable.
 *
 * **No `layout` prop**, here or anywhere in the board tree — there is a source
 * scan in render.test.tsx that fails the build on one. The idle is CSS keyframes
 * on `transform` alone, so it is compositor work rather than a JS loop running
 * for the weeks this page stays open without reloading.

/**
 * How far right the podium has to move so its *mass* is centred, not its box.
 *
 * ── Why a bounding box is the wrong thing to centre ──
 *
 * The arrangement is 2-1-3 with heights descending 1 > 2 > 3, so the left pillar
 * is taller than the right one and carries more dark area. The bounding box is
 * perfectly symmetric — measured at 0.0px off the channel centre — and the group
 * still reads left, because the eye weighs ink rather than edges.
 *
 * Measured on the running board, the area-weighted centroid sits **17.9px left**
 * of the box centre at 1920, 14.9px at 1600 and 18.6px at 2000. It is not a
 * constant, so it cannot be a constant in the stylesheet.
 *
 * ── Why this is measured rather than derived in CSS ──
 *
 * With equal widths the closed form is `pitch × (hLeft − hRight) / Σh`, and
 * `Σh` depends on the pillars' content height — which CSS knows only after
 * layout. So the heights are read back from the rendered pillars, which is the
 * same thing `WeeklyGrid` does for the flip's travel.
 *
 * Transform rather than margin: it moves the group without moving the layout, so
 * observing the row's size cannot feed back into it.
