/**
 * The mark that leaves the podium: closed, carried down to the list, opened.
 *
 * Rendered as a single overlay over the whole board rather than inside either
 * the pillar or the row, because it belongs to neither for most of its life — it
 * starts in one, ends in the other, and spends the middle crossing the space
 * between. Positioning it absolutely against the board is what lets it travel
 * without either container having to clip or grow.
 *
 * ── Why there is a back face ──
 *
 * `backface-visibility: hidden` needs two faces to work against. Without a back,
 * a disc turned past 90° shows its own front mirrored — measured on `/weekly`
 * before that disc had one.
 *
 * **The shadow is a `box-shadow` on the faces, never a `filter` on the disc.** A
 * filter of any kind forces the used value of `transform-style` to `flat`, which
 * silently destroys the 3D context and turns the flip into a horizontal squash.
 * That one cost an afternoon on the weekly board.

 * Out to face-down, hold there through the travel, back to face-up.

 * One continuous direction — 0° → 180° → 360° — rather than turning back the way
 * it came. A disc that unwinds reads as the move being undone; one that keeps
 * going reads as having arrived.
