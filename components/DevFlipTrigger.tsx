/**
 * Fire an overtake flip on demand, in development only.
 *
 * An observability affordance, not a feature. The flip fires when a rank changes
 * hands, which on live data happens a few times a day, and the stagger and the
 * travel are both things the spec says to tune *by watching* — which is not
 * possible if watching means waiting.
 *
 * ── It is not a second code path ──
 *
 * The only thing this does that the detector does not is *construct* the event.
 * From there it goes through `enqueueKicks` — the same function, the same
 * localStorage queue, the same replace-by-id, the same cap — and is drained by
 * the same `takeKick` inside `useKick`, which remains the only reader. Nothing
 * here touches `WeeklyGrid` or the cues. What you watch is what live data
 * produces.
 *
 * ── The board snaps back at the end. That is expected ──
 *
 * The cards in a flip are the real cards, and they end the sequence in their new
 * positions. What puts them there permanently is the *data* re-sorting, and this
 * trigger fabricates an event without fabricating the data behind it — so when
 * the held snapshot thaws there is nothing new to apply, and the two cards
 * return to where they started.
 *
 * That is not a bug to chase. Giving the trigger a client-side ordering override
 * would make it lie convincingly, and a second source of card order is the exact
 * thing the grid-is-the-brain design exists to remove. End-to-end verification
 * runs on `scripts/dev-churn.mjs`, which changes the published feed and
 * therefore produces a real reorder; these buttons are for watching a beat.
 */

/**
 * The cases the flip has to be judged at, all of them deliberate.
 *
 * `Δ1` inside a row is the pure exchange the design describes. `Δ1 across rows`
 * is rank 11 taking rank 10 — the two cards are in rows of different heights, so
 * this is the only button that exercises the mid-travel resize, and it is the
 * one most likely to look wrong. `Δ4` moves three uninvolved cards, which is
 * where the sliding cue earns its place.
