/**
 * How long until the Mesa Flea: a progress ring, and a figure beside it.
 *
 * **The ring never contains text.** It is a dial and nothing else, and the
 * figure always sits to its right — `25 days`, `9D 4H`, `04:12:33`,
 * `LIVE NOW`. Every mode therefore has identical structure, which is the whole
 * reason this shape was chosen over the prettier one that tucks short numbers
 * inside the ring: the wall crosses these thresholds at three in the morning
 * with nobody watching, and a layout that rearranges itself at a threshold is
 * a layout that can render wrongly for days before anyone notices.
 *
 * The arc measures elapsed *programme* time — anchor to Flea — rather than a
 * trailing window, so a half-full ring means the cohort is half over and says
 * something true instead of something decorative.
 *
 * Pure of the clock. `FleaStrip` owns the interval; this draws one state.
