/**
 * The wall's own slideshow: `/weekly` and `/podium`, thirty seconds each.
 *
 * This is the one piece of rotation logic in the project, and it exists because
 * the rotation moved in-house — see the note in AGENTS.md. If the campus
 * slideshow is ever pointed back at these two URLs, this component and that
 * external rotation will fight, and the symptom will be a slide that changes
 * early and at irregular intervals.
 *
 * ── Why a soft navigation, and not a reload ──
 *
 * The TV runs fullscreen with nobody at the laptop. `router.replace` swaps the
 * React tree **without replacing the document**, so fullscreen survives — true
 * both of an F11 fullscreen and of the JS `requestFullscreen` API, which exits
 * on any top-level navigation and cannot be re-entered without a user gesture.
 * A `location.href =` or a `<meta refresh>` would drop the wall to a windowed
 * browser within a minute of being set up, and stay that way for weeks.
 *
 * Both routes are prerendered static, so the swap costs one small RSC payload,
 * cached after the first time. `prefetch` pays even that before it is needed.
 *
 * **`replace`, not `push`.** `push` would grow the history stack by one entry
 * every thirty seconds — about two thousand a day on a page that never reloads.
 *
 * ── What the swap costs, and what it does not ──
 *
 * Each board fetches on mount, so the CSVs are now read about every thirty
 * seconds rather than every sixty. That is wasted cycles rather than a
 * correctness problem: the consolidator writes every ten minutes and Google
 * caches the published CSV for about five, so the extra reads return the same
 * bytes. `useWallData` is deliberately untouched by this.
 *
 * What does *not* reset is anything that matters. The board's last-known ranks,
 * the pending overtake queue and the raw CSV cache all live in localStorage, so
 * a remounted board re-reads them before the browser paints and detection picks
 * up exactly where it left off. A rank change that happens while a slide is off
 * screen is still detected the moment it comes back.
