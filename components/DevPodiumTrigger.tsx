/**
 * Fire a podium overtake on demand, in development only.
 *
 * An observability affordance, not a feature. `/podium` ranks on all-time
 * revenue, so a change at the top happens a few times a *week* rather than a few
 * times a day — and the beats this animation is built from are things to judge by
 * watching, which is not possible if watching means waiting for the cohort.
 *
 * ── It is not a second code path ──
 *
 * The only thing this does that the detector does not is *construct* the event.
 * From there it goes through `enqueueKicks` — the same function, the same
 * localStorage queue, the same replace-by-id, the same cap — and is drained by
 * the same `takeKick` inside `useKick`, which remains the only reader. Nothing
 * here touches the board or the beats. What you watch is what live data
 * produces.
 *
 * ── The board snaps back at the end. That is expected ──
 *
 * The pillars in a sequence are the real pillars, and the data behind them is
 * frozen for its duration. This trigger fabricates an event without fabricating
 * the data behind it, so when the held snapshot thaws there is nothing new to
 * apply and the board returns to where it started.
 *
 * That is not a bug to chase. Giving the trigger a client-side ordering override
 * would make it lie convincingly, and a second source of board order is the exact
 * thing the ranking-is-the-single-authority design exists to remove.
 * `scripts/dev-churn.mjs` changes the published feed and therefore produces a
 * real reorder; these buttons are for watching a beat.

/**
 * The cases the sequence has to be judged at.
 *
 * The first three are the event: a venture crossing *into* the top three, which
 * is the only shape that gets the close-travel-open. Entering at 1 is the
 * loudest and the one most likely to look wrong, because the departing mark
 * crosses the whole board diagonally. The last is the quiet shape — two list
 * rows trading places, which gets a slide and nothing else, and is here so the
 * two can be compared back to back.
