# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# BYOB Campus TV Wall

Two pages displayed on TVs across Mesa campus during BYOB Cohort 2026, driven from a
laptop over HDMI. The wall rotates between its own two slides every thirty seconds; if it
also sits inside a wider campus slideshow, that outer rotation is someone else's.

**This is a display system, not a dashboard.** Nobody interacts with it. It runs
unattended for weeks. The bar: on a wall nobody is actively watching, a bug that renders
convincingly can run for weeks.

The design is in `docs/DESIGN.md`. Read it before any slice of work.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # local dev
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run test         # vitest run
npm run build        # next build
```

## Non-negotiable

- **No backend.** No API routes, no serverless functions, no database, no auth. Two
  public published-CSV URLs, fetched from the browser. If a change needs a server, stop.
- **This project never writes to `BYOB_MASTER`.** It reads two published CSVs over plain
  HTTP with no credentials. There is no token, no service account, no Apps Script here.
- **Never hardcode a hex.** `.claude/skills/mesa-design/colors_and_type.css` is the only
  file that may contain one. TV-specific additions go in `app/mesa-tv.css`, marked as an
  extension, deriving from existing brand tokens — no new hues.
- **No filler content.** Empty is a valid state. The wall being quiet is what makes it
  loud when something happens. No spinners, ever — first paint reads cached CSV.
- **No trigger types beyond the 15 in the design.** The list was deliberately narrowed.
- **The rotation between the two slides is ours, and it is the only rotation logic
  here.** `components/Rotator.tsx`, thirty seconds a slide, by soft navigation. That
  reverses the original "external system" rule, which assumed the campus slideshow drove
  both URLs. It must never become a page reload: the TV runs fullscreen with nobody at
  the laptop, and a reload drops out of fullscreen for good. Nothing else about the
  rotation — ordering with the other Mesa slides, what else is in the loop — belongs
  here.

## Domain

- 42 workbooks, `SLE-C401`–`SLE-C442`. Team IDs come from `Team Links` col A, rows 6–47.
- **Logged (proof-backed) revenue is the only figure used.** `Daily Team Summary` col B,
  which is `SUMIFS('Daily Dump'!$N:$N, 'Daily Dump'!$D:$D, "Sale")`. Column N is already
  proof-gated upstream (proof = `Yes` AND units ≥ 1). Summing `Amount` (col I) instead
  would count unproven and zero-unit sales and silently disagree with every existing
  rollup. Verified revenue is not used anywhere in this project.
- Ranking: **logged revenue desc → units desc → team ID asc**, matching the admin
  dashboard's `compareTieBreak`. Rank is computed client-side, so the sort is the single
  authority on order.
- Challenge weeks 1–8, anchored **20 July 2026** (not the 21st). Mesa Flea: **13 September
  2026**, 10:00 IST assumed — moved from 6 September, and it lives in `TV_Cohort`
  rather than in code, so the wall picked the change up on its next poll. Capital repayment: 30 September 2026.
- A team with an empty `venture_name` **does** fire a trigger, like any other. This line
  previously claimed the opposite; `lib/overtake.ts` never enforced it, and the behaviour
  it describes is not the one we want — an unnamed team that overtakes has still overtaken.
  The card carries its Team ID rather than a blank, so the wall celebrates `SLE-C407` by
  name-or-ID rather than not at all. Decided in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-weekly-card-grid.md` §3; the doc was corrected to
  match the code, not the other way round.
- Currency: `Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN')` — `₹1,04,500`, not `₹104,500`.

## Traps that report nothing

All of these render convincingly and pass typecheck, lint and tests. Verify by reading
`getComputedStyle` / `getBoundingClientRect` back from a real browser at **1920×1080**,
not by reading source.

- **Tailwind v4 utilities lose to unlayered CSS.** The design system's `.overline`,
  `.small`, `.caption` and `h1`–`h4` each set a colour, so unlayered they beat every
  `text-*` utility. `globals.css` imports the system with `layer(components)` for this
  reason. Class rules in `mesa-tv.css` go inside its `@layer components` block.
- **`.overline` is also a real Tailwind utility** (`text-decoration-line: overline`), and
  utilities beat the components layer. `globals.css` carries an unlayered override.
  Before using any design-system class name, check it against `overline`, `underline`,
  `truncate`, `container`, `block`, `inline`, `table`, `grid`, `flex`, `hidden`,
  `visible`, `fixed`, `static`, `sticky`, `capitalize`, `uppercase`, `lowercase`,
  `italic`, `antialiased`.
- **A non-existent Tailwind step emits no rule and no warning.** `opacity-16` does
  nothing. Use a real step or an explicit arbitrary value, then confirm the computed one.
- **Motion `layout` transforms are ignored by `<tr>`.** Reordering rows must use grid
  rows with ARIA table roles. Measured in the dashboard: 30 animation frames with the
  transform present and the row at exactly one position throughout.
- **Google's published CSV carries a UTF-8 BOM and CRLF endings.** `﻿team_id` is not
  `team_id`. papaparse handles both; a hand-rolled parser does not.
- **`cache: 'no-store'` on both fetches.** Without it the browser HTTP cache serves one
  body for the life of a page that never manually reloads, and the wall freezes silently.
- **A revoked sheet returns an HTML login page with HTTP 200.** Status codes pass it;
  only the parsed-row gate catches it.

## Working style

Detective, not decorator: theory of the crime, then evidence, then fix. Surgical changes,
one at a time. Commit after every completed slice — git is the rollback path. The user is
non-technical but builds automations, and wants honest pushback over agreeableness.
