 * slide replaced it with the spine. What the two boards must still share is the
 * data rather than the furniture: the same lockup, the same provenance stamp and
 * the same countdown brain all appear on both, arranged differently.
 *
 * The page has no padding of its own. The spine is full-bleed to three edges by
 * design, so the frame's margins belong to the board and are declared there.
