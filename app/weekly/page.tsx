/**
 * Slide 2 — the weekly board, forty cards in a 4 × 10 grid.
 *
 * The board is inert unless a rank changed hands. **No `layout` prop anywhere in
 * this tree**: a team's week revenue ticking up by ₹200 without moving changes
 * the sort input, and Motion's layout animation would answer that with a small
 * shift on every poll. Movement on this wall means something happened.
 *
 * ── The freeze rides the flip exactly ──
 *
 * Cards are keyed by team id, so a snapshot applied mid-flip would re-slot the
 * two contestants underneath their own animation — they would arrive at a
 * destination that had moved. Held snapshots land on settle instead, which is
 * also what makes the ending invisible: both cards finish exactly on the
 * positions the re-sorted board is about to give them.

          depends on the sheet having published one. It used to read `BYOB Week

          not captioning it. A heading that says nothing numeric cannot be wrong

          revenue whatever the heading says, and the value is what the dev
