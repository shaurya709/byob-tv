 * weeks, and a font request that fails silently falls back to Georgia or
 * Helvetica on a screen nobody is watching closely enough to notice.
 *
 * Neither family may be named after the face it carries. `next/font` derives
 * its CSS family name from the const below, and `colors_and_type.css` already
 * declares seven static `Manrope` rules and four `MesaSerif` ones. CSS family
 * names match case-insensitively, so a collision merges the two sets and the
 * browser picks between them by weight — fetching a static face as well as the
 * variable one, or preferring a `local()` system font over the self-hosted
 * file. Hence `mesaBody` and `mesaSerifVariable`.

 * this const — confirmed in the built stylesheet, which emits `mesaBody` and
 * this face, not the filenames — and `colors_and_type.css` already declares
 * four `@font-face` rules for a family named `MesaSerif` whose `src` begins
 * `local("New York")`. CSS family matching is case-insensitive, so a const
 * named `mesaSerif` would merge with those rules, and the browser would then
 * choose between a self-hosted Source Serif 4 and whatever New York the
 * machine happens to have. Every Mac has New York. Two TVs would set the same
 * heading in two different serifs and nobody would think to check.
 *

 * this generates stays deliberately distinct from it.

/**
 * Archivo Black, for `BYOB` in `/podium`'s masthead and nothing else.
 *
 * **A third family, added deliberately and scoped to one word.** The rule this
 * bends is a real one — two families is what keeps two TVs setting the same
 * frame identically — so this is not a general display face. It is a wordmark,
 * it appears once, and it is the only thing on either wall that uses it.
 *
 * It is *bundled*, not linked. The 9.8KB latin subset sits in `app/fonts/` next
 * to the other two with its OFL licence, because a `fonts.googleapis.com` link
 * would put a runtime network dependency on a wall that runs unattended for
 * weeks — and a font request that fails silently falls back to Helvetica on a
 * screen nobody is watching closely enough to notice.
 *
 * Single weight, and that is the point: Archivo Black *is* the 900. There is no
 * axis to set, so nothing here can accidentally render it lighter. It replaced
 * MesaSerif at 900, which was the heaviest thing this wall could previously
 * draw.
 *
 * The const is not named `archivoBlack` for the same reason `mesaBody` is not
 * named `Manrope`: `next/font/local` derives the CSS family name from it, and a
 * name matching a real family risks merging with any `local()` rule that shares
 * it.

 * **The fourth family, and the point at which this needs saying out loud:** two
 * faces is what guarantees two TVs set the same frame identically, and this wall
 * now carries four. Each addition has been scoped to one job — Archivo Black to
 * the `BYOB` wordmark, this to venture names — and all four are bundled, so the
 * risk is bundle size rather than a CDN that might not answer. Together the two
 * additions are 18KB. But a fifth should be argued for rather than assumed.
 *
 * Bundled, not linked, for the same reason as the others: a
 * `fonts.googleapis.com` request is a runtime network dependency on a wall that
 * runs unattended for weeks.
 *
 * **One weight, and no real lowercase** — Bebas Neue maps lowercase to capitals
 * by design, which suits a name that was already being uppercased in CSS. It
 * also means every token that sets it must ask for 400: at 800 the browser
 * synthesises a fake bold by smearing the outlines, which on a condensed face
 * closes the counters and turns a name into a block at six metres.
