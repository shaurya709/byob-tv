/**
 * The overtake flip's clock. Every number that says *when* lives here.
 *
 * ── One shared timeline, not N animations ──
 *
 * A beat is a window on this timeline. Nothing waits for a completion callback
 * and nothing waits on a timeout: every animation in the sequence runs for
 * `TOTAL` seconds and uses `times` to say which part of that span it occupies.
 *
 * Rows are unmounted mid-sequence every time the rotation moves on, so a chain
 * of callbacks would need teardown at every beat to avoid firing into a dead
 * component, and a chain of timeouts would need the same plus it would drift. A
 * shared timeline has nothing to tear down — one unmount stops everything — and
 * two beats cannot disagree about when the first one ended, because neither of
 * them decides.
 *
 * ── The sequence ──
 *
 * 1. **Flip out.** The card turns to its back — Mesa on Deep Forest Green — and
 *    its base merges up into the disc and vanishes on the same window. The base
 *    does not fade where it stands: it is *absorbed*, which is what makes the
 *    disc read as having picked the card's contents up rather than as having
 *    outlived them.
 * 2. **The defender goes a beat later.** `STAGGER` behind the attacker, so the
 *    two read as cause and effect rather than as a simultaneous blink. This is
 *    the whole reason the flip communicates an overtake at all.
 * 3. **Travel.** Both face-down discs cross to each other's slots, resizing on
 *    the way if the two slots are in rows of different heights. The resize rides
 *    the travel rather than snapping at either end.
 * 4. **Flip in.** Each turns face-up in its new place.
 * 5. **Base in.** The base slides back down out of the disc and reappears.
 *
 * Unlike the boot kick this replaced, the timeline is **not** a function of the
 * climb size. The kick's length scaled with Δ because its climb was a vertical
 * ride down a column and a longer ride needed longer. A flip's travel is a
 * straight line between two cells and reads the same whether it crosses one slot
 * or nine, so one clock serves every event and the queue's guard has one answer.
