 * The queue across a mount — which is now a thirty-second event, not a
 * once-a-deploy one, because `Rotator` swaps the two slides by unmounting one
 * board and mounting the other.
 *
 * Both tests here are invisible on screen in the way this project keeps finding:
 * the discard failing means a confident, well-timed animation between two teams
 * that never overtook anyone, and the drain failing means a wall that simply
 * never animates. Neither shows an error.
