 *
 * Only the CSV cache survives the v2 pivot; it is blindly overwritten every 60
 * seconds. The rank state and the animation queue land here again in session 2
 * with their own keys, because their write patterns differ from this one and
 * from each other — merging them would rewrite the whole store 1,440 times a
 * day and multiply the window for a cross-tab clobber by sixty, for nothing.
 *
 * ── Version lives in the key name ──
 *
 * A version bump makes the old key simply *absent*, which routes into the branch
 * the code already has to support for a brand-new TV. Putting a version inside
 * the value would need a migration branch at read time — a second read path, for
 * a store whose entire contents can be rebuilt from the sheet.
 *
 * Bumped to v2 with the six-column feed. Without it, every wall already running
 * would boot holding a v1 cache, throw on it, and log a parse error on first
 * paint until the first fetch landed — noise that reads like a fault and is not.
