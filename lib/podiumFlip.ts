/**
 * The podium's overtake clock. Every number that says *when* lives here.
 *
 * ── Two shapes of overtake, and only one of them is a story ──
 *
 * A change inside ranks 4–10 is two rows trading places. It gets a slide, and
 * nothing more: seven near-identical bars swapping is information, not an event,
 * and dressing it up would spend the wall's one interrupt on the quietest thing
 * that can happen.
 *
 * A change that crosses **into the podium** is the event. A venture is leaving
 * the top three and another is taking its place, and the animation says exactly
 * that in the order it happens:
 *
 * 1. **Close.** The departing venture's mark turns to its back — Mesa on Deep
 *    Forest Green. It stops being that venture's mark before it moves, so the
 *    thing crossing the board is anonymous rather than a logo flying about.
 * 2. **Travel.** The closed disc crosses from its podium pillar to the row it is
 *    dropping into, resizing on the way.
 * 3. **Open.** It turns face-up in the list, and is that venture again.
 * 4. **Arrive.** Only then does the promoted venture appear on the pillar. Last,
 *    deliberately: the seat has to be visibly empty before someone takes it, or
 *    the two ventures read as having swapped by magic.
 *
 * ── One shared timeline, not four animations ──
 *
 * A beat is a window on this timeline. Nothing waits for a completion callback
 * and nothing waits on a timeout; every animation runs for `TOTAL` seconds and
 * uses `times` to say which part of that span it occupies. The board can be
 * unmounted mid-sequence — a rotation moving on, a resize — and one unmount stops
 * everything, where a chain of callbacks would need teardown at every beat.
 *
 * This is the same argument `lib/flipTimeline.ts` makes for `/weekly`, and the
 * two are deliberately separate files: the beats differ, the geometry differs,
 * and a shared "flip timeline" that both boards bent would be a worse thing than
 * two clocks that each say what their own board does.

   * invisible rather than a snap.
