 *
 * `/podium` and `/weekly` stay reachable as standalone URLs for inspection, so
 * two of them can be open at once with only one on screen. Without this gate,
 * two renderers would each run a read-compute-write cycle every 60 seconds
 * against the same localStorage: duplicated animations and clobbered writes.
 *
 * The rotation shell in session 2 fetches once at the shell level and passes
 * data down, which is the normal path. This gate is what keeps the standalone
 * URLs honest alongside it.

   * ── The freeze is what keeps a kick self-contained ──
   *
   * Rows are keyed by team id, so the moment a re-sorted snapshot lands, React
   * moves every keyed row to its new grid slot — instantly, silently, under
   * whatever is animating. A poll arriving mid-kick would reorder the board
   * beneath the two rows performing on it, and the whole rows-are-the-actors
   * architecture fails without a visible error. So while a kick plays, ticks
   * still fetch, gate, cache and detect exactly as always — but the snapshot is
   * *held* here rather than applied, and lands when the animation settles. The
   * sequence never depends on when the data poll happens to arrive.
   *
   * The hold has a second arm: the tick that *detects* an overtake also holds
   * its own snapshot. That tick's data is the re-sorted board; applying it
   * immediately would put the attacker in its new slot one render before the
   * kick starts, and the animation would then perform a climb that had already
   * happened. Holding it is what makes the end of the kick seamless — the
   * animation carries the rows to exactly the positions the held snapshot
   * assigns them on settle.
   *
   * One mechanism, not two: there is no polling pause and no second ordering
   * path. Ticks run on their clock; only `setSnapshot` is deferred.
