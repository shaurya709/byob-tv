   * ── Why the sheet subtracts rather than sums a date range ──
   *
   * `Daily Team Summary` col B is cumulative, and `Daily Dump`'s date column is
   * empty on 99.4% of sale rows, so there is no windowed figure to read
   * anywhere in `BYOB_MASTER`. Photographing the running total when the window
   * opens and subtracting it is the only thing that can work.

   * figure, and proof can be revoked after the shutter closes: a sale logged
   * before the baseline that later has its proof set to `No` shrinks the
   * all-time total while the photograph still shows the larger number. Three
   * teams were in this state on 19 August. Nothing clamps it — the comparator
   * sorts the true value and the card prints it, so a team that went backwards
   * says so from the bottom of the board.
