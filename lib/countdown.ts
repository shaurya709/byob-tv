/**
 * The calendar countdown's one brain: time-to-Flea in, display state out.
 *
 * Every threshold transition lives here and nowhere else — the component that
 * draws the calendar never compares a timestamp. Pure of the clock: `now`
 * arrives as an argument (defaulting to the real clock only at the call site's
 * convenience), which is what makes the four modes testable without faking a
 * global.
 *
 * The escalation, from far out to done:
 *
 *   days       ≥15 days out          "25"        calendar days, counted in IST
 *   daysHours  <15 days, ≥24 hours   "6D 4H"     floored, like a clock reads
 *   timer      <24 hours, not yet    "04:12:33"  live seconds
 *   live       during the event      "LIVE NOW"
 *   hidden     after it ends         ""          the slot goes quiet for good
 *
 * The far mode counts *calendar days*, in the sheet's timezone, where the near
 * mode floors elapsed time like a clock. On 12 August the Flea is "25 days
 * away" at breakfast and at midnight — the number a person would say — whereas
 * a 24-hour-block count would tick from 26 to 25 at 10:00, an hour nobody can
 * name. IST and never the browser's locale, for the same reason as
 * lib/schedule.ts: a laptop still set to another timezone must not shift the
 * day boundary.

 * **No milliseconds, at any band.** They are unreadable across a corridor, and
 * re-rendering a digit every frame for days on a panel that never sleeps is how
 * burn-in happens. Seconds already read as urgent.
 *
 * The two clock bands are not padded to two digits. `2:14:30` is a duration, and
